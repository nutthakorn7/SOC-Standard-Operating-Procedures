## Gap Risk Scoring

### Scoring Matrix

| Factor | 1 — Low | 2 — Medium | 3 — High | 4 — Critical |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Business impact** | Minimal disruption | Moderate impact | Significant loss | Business-critical failure |
| **Regulatory risk** | Advisory finding | Minor non-compliance | Material non-compliance | Regulatory action / fine |
| **Exploit likelihood** | Unlikely | Possible | Probable | Active exploitation |
| **Data sensitivity** | Public data | Internal data | Confidential / PII | Restricted / regulated |

### Risk Score Calculation

| Combined Score | Priority | Remediation Timeline | Reporting |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **13–16** | 🔴 Critical | < 30 days | Weekly to CISO |
| **9–12** | 🟠 High | < 90 days | Monthly to CISO |
| **5–8** | 🟡 Medium | < 180 days | Quarterly review |
| **1–4** | 🟢 Low | Next audit cycle | Annual review |
