## 1. Overview

PCI-DSS v4.0 (effective March 2024) defines security requirements for organizations handling payment card data. SOC teams play a critical role in meeting **monitoring, detection, and response** requirements.

### SOC-Relevant Requirements

```mermaid
pie title PCI-DSS Requirements Covered by SOC
    "SOC Directly Responsible" : 4
    "SOC Contributes" : 5
    "Not SOC Scope" : 3
```

> SOC operations directly address **Requirements 10, 11, 12.10** and contribute to **Requirements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7**.

## 6. Audit Preparation Checklist

Use this checklist before a PCI-DSS audit:

- [ ] **Log retention** — Verify 12 months of logs available (3 months immediately accessible)
- [ ] **Monitoring coverage** — Confirm all CDE (Cardholder Data Environment) systems in Log Source Matrix
- [ ] **Alert response** — Document SLA compliance for P1/P2 alerts
- [ ] **IR testing** — Provide evidence of annual Purple Team exercise or tabletop
- [ ] **Training records** — Show analyst training completion dates
- [ ] **Change detection** — Demonstrate file integrity monitoring on payment pages
- [ ] **Vulnerability scans** — Show quarterly internal/external scan results
- [ ] **Incident log** — Provide ticketing system export with resolution times

## 7. Key Differences: PCI-DSS v3.2.1 → v4.0

| Area | v3.2.1 | v4.0 (New) | SOC Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Log review** | Daily manual review | Automated monitoring + targeted risk analysis | Increase SIEM automation |
| **Detection** | IDS/IPS required | + Network behavioral analysis | Add network anomaly detection |
| **IR testing** | Annual test | Annual test + scenario-specific exercises | Add Purple Team exercises |
| **Authentication** | MFA for remote access | MFA for all CDE access | Monitor for MFA bypass |
| **Customized approach** | N/A | Organizations can customize controls | Document alternative approaches |
