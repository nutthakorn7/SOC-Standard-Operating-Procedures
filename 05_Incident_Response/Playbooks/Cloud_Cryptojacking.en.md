# Playbook: Cloud Cryptojacking Response

**ID**: PB-47
**Severity**: High | **Category**: Impact / Resource Hijacking
**MITRE ATT&CK**: [T1496](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/) (Resource Hijacking)
**Trigger**: Cloud cost spike alert, unusual compute usage, EDR (crypto miner process), new large instances launched, API key abuse detected

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Cloud cryptojacking can rack up hundreds of thousands in compute costs within hours. Attackers use stolen API keys or exposed credentials to spin up GPU instances for crypto mining.

## 1. Immediate Actions (First 10 Minutes)

| # | Action | Owner |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Terminate ALL unauthorized compute instances | Cloud Admin |
| 2 | Revoke compromised API keys/access tokens | Cloud Admin |
| 3 | Set billing alert and spending limit immediately | Finance |
| 4 | Check for additional backdoor access (IAM users, roles) | SecEng |
| 5 | Audit CloudTrail/Activity Log for all actions by compromised key | SOC |
| 6 | Notify finance of estimated unauthorized charges | SOC Manager |

## 2. Investigation Checklist

### Cloud Platform Audit
- [ ] CloudTrail/Activity logs: who created the instances?
- [ ] Which API key/service account was used?
- [ ] Where was the credential exposed? (GitHub, .env, CI/CD)
- [ ] What instance types and regions were used?
- [ ] Were any additional IAM users/roles created?
- [ ] Are there persistent resources (Lambda, ECS tasks)?

### Cost Analysis
- [ ] Exact unauthorized compute charges
- [ ] Duration instances were running
- [ ] Estimated total financial impact
- [ ] Can cloud provider reverse charges?

## 3. Containment

| Scope | Action |
|:---|:---|
| **Instances** | Terminate all unauthorized compute |
| **API keys** | Revoke immediately, rotate all |
| **IAM** | Remove unauthorized users/roles |
| **Budget** | Set hard spending limit |
| **Secrets** | Scan repos for exposed credentials |

## 4. Evidence Checklist

| Evidence Type | What to Collect | Source | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Compute evidence | Unauthorized instances, regions, sizes, tags, launch times | Cloud console / asset inventory | Quantifies abuse footprint |
| Identity evidence | API keys, roles, service accounts, source IPs, CI/CD usage | Cloud audit / IAM | Identifies the abused credential path |
| Cost evidence | Charges, budgets, anomalous spend, provider credits/case IDs | Billing / finance records | Supports business response and reimbursement |
| Persistence evidence | Extra users, roles, Lambda/ECS tasks, startup scripts | Cloud audit / config / code repos | Shows whether the attacker left durable access |
| Exposure evidence | Where credentials were stored or leaked | Secret scanning / SCM / CI logs | Drives root-cause remediation |

## 5. Minimum Telemetry Required

| Telemetry Source | Required For | Priority | Blind Spot If Missing |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| Cloud activity logs | Resource creation, key use, role changes, region spread | Required | Cannot trace the abuse path or actor |
| Billing and budget telemetry | Cost spike and unauthorized usage scope | Required | Abuse may be detected too late |
| IAM and secret-scanning telemetry | Exposed keys, unused roles, privileged accounts | Required | Credential root cause remains unclear |
| Asset and runtime telemetry | Running instances, containers, functions, persistence | Recommended | Hidden persistence may survive cleanup |
| Provider support/case records | Charge dispute and abuse case context | Recommended | Recovery and financial follow-up slow down |

## 6. False Positive and Tuning Guide

| Scenario | Why It Looks Suspicious | How to Validate | Tuning Action | Escalate If |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Planned burst compute or GPU job | High spend and new instances can resemble mining | Confirm workload owner, budget, region, and image | Tune for approved tags, accounts, and schedules only | Mining pools, unknown images, or unrelated IAM actions appear |
| Load test or simulation | Temporary compute spike may look abusive | Validate test window and source pipeline | Lower severity during approved stress tests | Resources persist after test or spread to unusual regions |
| Auto-scaling anomaly during incident | Rapid scale-out can resemble attacker-created instances | Confirm application incident and autoscaling policy | Tune against approved ASG/service identities | Manual launches or spend remains high after app issue ends |
| Security scan of leaked credentials | Detection activity may hit many repos/accounts | Validate scanner identity and scope | Allowlist scanner identities narrowly | The same credentials are actually used to launch resources |

## 7. Post-Incident

| Question | Answer |
|:---|:---|
| How were cloud credentials exposed? | [GitHub/env/CI/CD] |
| Were budget alerts configured? | [Yes/No] |
| Was IAM least-privilege enforced? | [Status] |
| Total financial impact? | [$Amount] |
| Were spending limits in place? | [Yes/No] |
