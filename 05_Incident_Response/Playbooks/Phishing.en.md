## 1. Analysis (Triage)

### 1.1 Header Analysis

| Check | How | Tool |
|:---|:---|:---|
| SPF result | Check `Received-SPF` header | Email header analyzer |
| DKIM signature | Verify `DKIM-Signature` validity | Email header analyzer |
| DMARC result | Check `Authentication-Results` | Email header analyzer |
| Return-Path | Compare with From address | Manual inspection |
| Received chain | Trace originating server IP | Manual + GeoIP |
| X-Originating-IP | Identify sender IP | Header inspection |

### 1.2 Content Analysis

| Item | Action | Tool |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sender domain** | Search reputation | VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, WHOIS |
| **URLs** | Extract and check reputation | URLhaus, VirusTotal, urlscan.io |
| **Attachments** | Submit to sandbox (**NEVER open locally**) | Hybrid Analysis, Joe Sandbox, ANY.RUN |
| **File hash** | Check against TI feeds | VirusTotal, ThreatFox |
| **Language/tone** | Assess urgency, grammar, brand impersonation | Manual review |
| **Reply-to** | Compare with From — mismatch = suspicious | Manual inspection |

### 1.3 Scope Assessment

- [ ] How many users received this email?
- [ ] How many users clicked the link / opened the attachment?
- [ ] Any credential submissions on the landing page?
- [ ] Is this part of a targeted campaign or mass phishing?

## 2. Containment

### 2.1 Immediate Actions (within 15 minutes)

| # | Action | Tool | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Block sender email/domain in Email Gateway | M365 / Google / Proofpoint | ☐ |
| 2 | Purge email from ALL mailboxes | Search & Purge / Compliance Search | ☐ |
| 3 | Block malicious URLs at proxy/firewall | Web proxy, firewall | ☐ |
| 4 | Block file hash in EDR (if attachment) | CrowdStrike / SentinelOne | ☐ |
| 5 | Add IoCs to SIEM watchlist | SIEM TI integration | ☐ |

### 2.2 If User Clicked Link (No Credential Entry)

| # | Action | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Scan endpoint for malware/persistence | ☐ |
| 2 | Check browser history for redirects | ☐ |
| 3 | Monitor endpoint for 24 hours | ☐ |

### 2.3 If User Entered Credentials (Full Compromise)

| # | Action | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Force password reset immediately | ☐ |
| 2 | Revoke all active sessions/tokens | ☐ |
| 3 | Reset MFA and re-enroll | ☐ |
| 4 | Check for mailbox rules (forwarding, redirect) | ☐ |
| 5 | Check for OAuth app consents | ☐ |
| 6 | Review login history for suspicious access | ☐ |
| 7 | Cross-reference with [PB-05 Account Compromise](Account_Compromise.en.md) | ☐ |

## 3. IoC Collection

| Type | Value | Source |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Sender Email | | Email header |
| Sender Domain | | Email header |
| Sender IP | | Received chain |
| URL(s) | | Email body |
| Landing Page IP | | DNS lookup |
| Attachment Name | | Email |
| Attachment Hash (SHA256) | | Sandbox |
| Dropped File Hash | | Sandbox |

---

## 4. Escalation Criteria

| Condition | Escalate To |
|:---|:---|
| > 10 users received the same email | SOC Lead |
| Any user entered credentials | Tier 2 + Account Security |
| Attachment confirmed as malware | Tier 2 + IR |
| Executive/VIP targeted (spear-phishing) | SOC Manager + CISO |
| Part of ongoing campaign | Threat Intel team |
| Data breach suspected | Legal + Compliance |

---

## 5. Recovery

- [ ] Unblock user account after password reset and MFA re-enrollment
- [ ] Confirm no unauthorized mailbox rules remain
- [ ] Verify no OAuth/API keys were created by attacker
- [ ] Remove user from "High Risk" monitoring after 48 hours (if clean)

---

## 6. Post-Incident

- [ ] Update email gateway rules if new pattern identified
- [ ] Submit phishing URL/domain to community blocklists
- [ ] Create/update Sigma detection rule if novel technique
- [ ] Send awareness reminder to affected users
- [ ] Document in [Incident Report](../../templates/incident_report.en.md)
