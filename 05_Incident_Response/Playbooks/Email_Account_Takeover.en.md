# Playbook: Email Account Takeover Response

**ID**: PB-42
**Severity**: High | **Category**: Collection / Impact
**MITRE ATT&CK**: [T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/) (Email Collection), [T1114.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003/) (Email Forwarding Rule)
**Trigger**: User report (suspicious sent emails), SIEM (new inbox rule), M365/Google alert (impossible travel login to mail), DLP (sensitive data forwarded)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Email account takeover enables BEC fraud, data exfiltration via forwarding rules, and supply chain attacks against contacts.

## 1. Immediate Actions (First 15 Minutes)

| # | Action | Owner |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Remove ALL suspicious inbox rules (forwarding, auto-delete) | M365/Google Admin |
| 2 | Reset user password immediately | IAM Team |
| 3 | Revoke all active sessions and tokens | M365/Google Admin |
| 4 | Revoke any unknown OAuth/app permissions | M365/Google Admin |
| 5 | Re-enroll MFA with a new device/method | IAM Team |
| 6 | Check Sent and Deleted Items for attacker actions | SOC T2 |

## 2. Investigation Checklist

### Mailbox Audit
- [ ] Sign-in logs: IP addresses, devices, locations, timestamps
- [ ] Inbox rules created/modified: forwarding destinations
- [ ] Sent Items: emails sent by attacker (phishing, BEC)
- [ ] Deleted Items: security alerts or evidence deleted
- [ ] OAuth/App permissions: unknown apps with mail.read scope
- [ ] Delegate access: other users added as delegates

### BEC Assessment
- [ ] Were any financial instructions sent (wire transfer, invoice change)?
- [ ] Were vendor/partner communications impersonated?
- [ ] Did attacker monitor specific email threads (invoice, contract)?
- [ ] Were any contacts phished from this account?

### Data Exposure
- [ ] What sensitive emails were accessible?
- [ ] Were attachments downloaded?
- [ ] Were emails forwarded to external addresses?
- [ ] PDPA/regulatory notification requirements?

## 3. Containment

| Scope | Action |
|:---|:---|
| **Inbox rules** | Remove all forwarding/delete rules |
| **Password** | Force reset + MFA re-enrollment |
| **Sessions** | Revoke all active sessions/tokens |
| **OAuth** | Remove unknown app permissions |
| **Delegates** | Remove unauthorized delegate access |

## 4. Post-Incident

| Question | Answer |
|:---|:---|
| How were email credentials compromised? | [Phishing/spray/leak] |
| Were inbox rule alerts configured? | [Yes/No] |
| Was conditional access policy enforced? | [Status] |
| Were financial controls (dual approval) in place? | [Status] |
