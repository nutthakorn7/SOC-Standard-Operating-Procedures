## Alert Triage — The First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Read the Alert
| Check | What to Look For |
|:---|:---|
| **Source** | Which tool generated this? (EDR, SIEM, IDS, email gateway) |
| **Severity** | How did the tool classify it? (Critical/High/Medium/Low) |
| **Asset** | What system is affected? (server, workstation, cloud resource) |
| **User** | Who is associated? (employee, service account, admin) |
| **Timestamp** | When did it happen? (business hours? weekend?) |

### Step 2: Quick Context Check (2 min)
```
□ Is this a known false positive? → Check FP runbook
□ Is this asset in maintenance? → Check change calendar
□ Has this user/host triggered similar alerts recently? → Check SIEM history (7 days)
□ Is this a repeat of an existing incident? → Check open tickets
```

### Step 3: Decide

```mermaid
graph TD
    Alert["🚨 New Alert"] --> Read["Read Alert Details"]
    Read --> Known{"Known FP pattern?"}
    Known -->|Yes| CloseFP["❌ Close as FP + Document"]
    Known -->|No/Unsure| Enrich["Enrich IOCs"]
    Enrich --> IOCMatch{"IOC matches TI feed?"}
    IOCMatch -->|Yes| TP["✅ True Positive → Escalate T2"]
    IOCMatch -->|No| Context{"Unusual context?"}
    Context -->|"Off-hours / VIP / Lateral"| TP
    Context -->|Normal behavior| FP["❌ False Positive → Close + Tune"]
    Alert --> Severity{"Is this P1/Critical?"}
    Severity -->|Yes| Immediate["🔴 ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY"]
```

| Decision | Action | Time Limit |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| ✅ **True Positive** | Create incident ticket → Escalate to T2 | 15 min |
| ⚠️ **Needs More Investigation** | Enrich IOCs → Pivot search → Then decide | 30 min |
| ❌ **False Positive** | Document reason → Close → Update tuning list | 5 min |
| 🔴 **Critical / P1** | **Escalate IMMEDIATELY** to T2/IR Lead | 0 min |

---

## Escalation Triggers — ALWAYS Escalate These

🚨 **Immediately escalate to T2/IR Lead if you see ANY of these:**

- Ransomware indicators (file encryption, shadow copy deletion)
- Active data exfiltration (large uploads to external IPs)
- Executive/VIP account compromise
- Multiple hosts showing same malicious behavior
- Production server compromise
- Confirmed malware execution
- Any OT/ICS alerts
- Active C2 beaconing detected
- Credential dumping tools (Mimikatz, secretsdump)
- You don't understand the alert after 30 minutes

## Common Alert Types & Quick Actions

### 🎣 Phishing Email Alert → PB-01
```
1. DO NOT click any links/attachments in the email
2. Check email headers → Is sender spoofed? (SPF/DKIM fail?)
3. Check URL reputation → VirusTotal, URLhaus
4. Check if other users received the same email → SIEM search
5. If malicious → Block sender + URL → Escalate to T2
```

### 🔐 Failed Login Alert (Brute Force) → PB-04
```
1. Check source IP → Internal or external?
2. Count failed attempts → How many? Over what period?
3. Check if any login succeeded after failures
4. If external + >10 attempts → Block IP at firewall
5. If succeeded after failures → Escalate to T2 (possible compromise)
```

### 🦠 Malware/EDR Alert → PB-03
```
1. Check detection name → What type of malware?
2. Was it blocked or did it execute?
3. Check process tree → What launched it?
4. If EXECUTED → Escalate to T2 immediately
5. If BLOCKED → Verify quarantine → Check for other instances
```

### 🌐 Web Attack / WAF Alert → PB-10
```
1. Check attack type → SQLi, XSS, RCE?
2. Check response code → 200 (possible success) vs 403/WAF blocked
3. Check source IP → Known scanner or targeted?
4. If response=200 + payload looks successful → Escalate to T2
5. If blocked → Log and monitor for persistence
```

### ☁️ Cloud Alert (AWS/Azure) → PB-16
```
1. What action triggered the alert?
2. Which IAM user/role?
3. From what IP/region?
4. Is this a known admin action?
5. If unusual region + privileged action → Escalate to T2
```

### 💀 Ransomware Indicators → PB-02
```
1. Are files being encrypted? Check file extension changes
2. Shadow copy deletion? (vssadmin delete shadows)
3. Ransom note present?
4. ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY — DO NOT wait
5. Isolate affected host if you have EDR capability
```

### 🔀 Lateral Movement → PB-12
```
1. Is a compromised host connecting to other internal hosts?
2. Check for PsExec, WMI, RDP from unusual sources
3. Are service accounts being used interactively?
4. Multiple hosts + same IOC = Escalate NOW
5. Document all affected hosts for T2
```

### 📤 Data Exfiltration → PB-08
```
1. Large outbound data transfer detected — how much? To where?
2. Is the destination IP known (cloud backup) or unknown?
3. Is this during business hours by a legitimate user?
4. Check DLP alerts for data classification
5. If sensitive data + external dest → Escalate immediately
```

### 👤 Insider Threat Indicators → PB-14
```
1. Unusual access patterns — off-hours, high volume
2. Accessing data outside job scope?
3. USB/external storage usage?
4. DO NOT alert the suspected user
5. Escalate to T2 + notify SOC Manager (HR may need to be involved)
```

### 🌊 DDoS Alert → PB-09
```
1. Is the service actually degraded? Check uptime monitoring
2. Traffic volume — how much above baseline?
3. Source — single IP or distributed?
4. Notify NOC/Network team immediately
5. Escalate to T2 for coordination
```

## False Positive Cheat Sheet

Common FP patterns — learn to recognize these quickly:

| Alert Type | Common FP Pattern | How to Confirm |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Brute force | Helpdesk users resetting passwords | Check if same user + helpdesk IP |
| Malware | AV flagging legitimate admin tools | Check if tool is in approved list |
| C2 beaconing | Regular heartbeat to SaaS/CDN | Check domain: Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS |
| Data exfil | Backup jobs, cloud sync | Check scheduled task + destination |
| Impossible travel | VPN split-tunnel + cloud login | Check if VPN IP matches user's VPN session |
| Web attack | Security scanners (Qualys, Nessus) | Check source IP against scanner list |
| Privilege escalation | Scheduled admin maintenance | Check change management calendar |
| Failed logins | Service account password rotation | Check if matches rotation schedule |

### FP Documentation Template
```
FP Reason: [why this is a false positive]
Pattern: [describe the recurring pattern]
Recommendation: □ Tune alert  □ Add exclusion  □ Accept risk
Approved by: [T2 analyst name]
```

# Process execution on endpoint
index=edr host="HOSTNAME" earliest=-48h
| stats count by process_name, parent_process, user | sort -count

# Email search — did others get the same phishing?
index=email subject="*SUSPICIOUS SUBJECT*" earliest=-7d
| stats count by recipient, src_sender, action
```

### Elastic (KQL)

```
# Alerts for a host
event.kind: "alert" AND host.name: "HOSTNAME"

# Failed logins
event.outcome: "failure" AND event.category: "authentication"
  AND source.ip: "X.X.X.X"

# Large outbound transfers
network.direction: "outbound" AND source.bytes > 100000000

# Process execution
event.category: "process" AND host.name: "HOSTNAME"
  AND process.name: ("powershell.exe" OR "cmd.exe" OR "wscript.exe")
```
