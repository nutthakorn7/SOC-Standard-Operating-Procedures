## Minimum Viable SOC Checklist

The absolute minimum you need to start — your "Day 1" checklist:

- [ ] **1 SIEM deployed** (Wazuh recommended for budget-conscious orgs)
- [ ] **3 log sources onboarded** (Firewall, Active Directory, Email)
- [ ] **3 people hired** (2 Tier 1 Analysts + 1 Manager)
- [ ] **5 detection rules enabled** (from our `08_Detection_Engineering/sigma_rules/`)
- [ ] **1 Playbook ready** (start with Phishing)
- [ ] **1 ticketing system** (TheHive or Jira)
- [ ] **1 escalation path defined** (Tier 1 → Manager → CISO)
- [ ] **1 communication channel** (Slack/Teams for SOC team)

> ✅ If you can check all 8 boxes above, you have a functioning SOC!

## Who Should Read What First

| Role | Read First | Use This Document To Decide |

## Minimum Outputs for the First 30 Days

- [ ] **SOC scope statement approved**: Define supported business units, operating hours, and severity model.
- [ ] **Critical asset list completed**: Identify crown-jewel systems, key identities, and business-critical services.
- [ ] **Top 3 log sources live**: Collect and retain logs from identity, email, and network/security control layers.
- [ ] **Top 5 use cases selected**: Start with Phishing, Malware, Brute Force, Account Compromise, and Ransomware.
- [ ] **Escalation path published**: Name the on-call manager, communications path, and executive notification trigger.
- [ ] **Case management process active**: Every alert investigation must produce a ticket, status, and owner.
- [ ] **First KPI baseline captured**: Measure alert volume, true positives, MTTD, MTTR, and false positive rate.
- [ ] **First management report delivered**: Provide a one-page summary of risks, incidents, gaps, and next actions.

## Quickstart Decision Criteria

| Decision Point | Minimum Condition | Owner |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Declare MVP SOC live** | SIEM collecting from at least 3 critical sources, 1 manager assigned, and 5 high-confidence detections monitored daily | SOC Manager |
| **Expand from 8x5 to extended coverage** | Alert backlog is stable, escalation path is tested, and after-hours business risk justifies coverage expansion | CISO + SOC Manager |
| **Add more detections** | Existing detections have named owners, tuning history, and documented response actions | Security Engineer |
| **Start executive reporting** | KPI definitions are agreed, data sources are stable, and major metric gaps are explained | CISO + SOC Manager |

## Escalation Triggers During the First 30 Days

- [ ] **Escalate to CISO** if critical systems are out of monitoring scope, executive accounts are unprotected, or severe incidents occur before baseline controls are live.
- [ ] **Escalate to SOC Manager** if alert backlog exceeds team capacity for more than one business day or if no owner is assigned for a Priority 1 gap.
- [ ] **Escalate to Security Engineering** if required telemetry from identity, email, or network controls is missing or unusable.
- [ ] **Escalate to business owners** if critical assets cannot provide logs, retention, or response support needed for incident handling.

## Frequently Asked Questions

| # | Question | Answer |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | How many people do I need to start a SOC? | Minimum 3: 2 T1 analysts + 1 manager. See [SOC Team Structure](../06_Operations_Management/SOC_Team_Structure.en.md) |
| 2 | What SIEM should I use? | For budget: Wazuh (free). For enterprise: Splunk, Elastic, or Sentinel. |
| 3 | How long until my SOC is effective? | Crawl (3 months), Walk (6 months), Run (12 months). Plan for at least 6 months. |
| 4 | Do I need 24/7 coverage from day 1? | No. Start with 8x5, then expand as maturity grows. |
| 5 | Which playbooks should I create first? | Phishing, Malware, Brute Force, Account Compromise, Ransomware. |
| 6 | How many detection rules do I need? | Start with 5-10 high-confidence rules, then expand. Quality > quantity. |
| 7 | Should I build or buy a SOC? | Start with internal + MSSP support if budget allows. See [SOC Assessment](../06_Operations_Management/SOC_Assessment_Checklist.en.md). |
| 8 | What certifications do analysts need? | T1: Security+/CySA+. T2: GCIH. T3: GCFA/OSCP. |
| 9 | How do I measure SOC effectiveness? | MTTD, MTTR, FP rate, SLA compliance. See [SOC Metrics](../06_Operations_Management/SOC_Metrics.en.md). |
| 10 | Can I use this repository for my organization? | Yes! Fork it, customize it, contribute back. See [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md). |
