| **Honeypot** | A decoy system designed to attract attackers, allowing the SOC to study their techniques. |

## I

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **IDS/IPS** | **Intrusion Detection System** (monitors and alerts) / **Intrusion Prevention System** (monitors and blocks). |
| **Incident** | A confirmed security event that requires response. Not all alerts become incidents. |
| **IOC (Indicator of Compromise)** | Evidence that an attack has occurred — malicious IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, URLs. |
| **IR (Incident Response)** | The process of detecting, analyzing, containing, and recovering from security incidents. |

## K-L

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Kill Chain** | A model describing the stages of a cyber attack: Recon → Weaponize → Deliver → Exploit → Install → C2 → Actions. |
| **Lateral Movement** | When an attacker moves from one compromised system to another within the same network. |
| **Log** | A recorded event from a system (firewall log, login log, application log). Logs are the raw data SOC analysts analyze. |

## M

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Malware** | Malicious software — viruses, trojans, ransomware, worms, spyware. |
| **MISP** | Open-source Threat Intelligence Platform for sharing IOCs between organizations. |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | A knowledge base of adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). The global standard for categorizing attacks. |
| **MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)** | Average time from an attack starting to the SOC detecting it. Lower is better. |
| **MTTR (Mean Time To Respond)** | Average time from detection to containment of an incident. Lower is better. |

## N-O

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **NDR (Network Detection and Response)** | Technology that monitors network traffic for threats. Complements EDR (which monitors endpoints). |
| **NIST** | National Institute of Standards and Technology — the U.S. agency that publishes cybersecurity frameworks and guidelines (SP 800 series). |
| **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** | Intelligence gathered from publicly available sources (social media, websites, public databases). |

## P

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **PDPA** | Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act — similar to GDPR. Requires organizations to protect personal data. |

## S

| **Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3** | SOC analyst levels. Tier 1 = triage, Tier 2 = investigation, Tier 3 = hunting and advanced analysis. |
| **TLP (Traffic Light Protocol)** | A system for classifying how sensitive information can be shared: TLP:RED (restricted), TLP:AMBER (limited), TLP:GREEN (community), TLP:CLEAR (public). |
| **True Positive (TP)** | An alert that correctly identifies a real security threat. The opposite of False Positive. |
| **TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** | The behavior patterns of an attacker — what they do (Tactic), how they do it (Technique), and the specific steps (Procedure). |
