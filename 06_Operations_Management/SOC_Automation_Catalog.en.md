## Automation Decision Framework

> Use this framework to decide whether to automate a process.

| Factor | Score 1 (Low) | Score 2 (Med) | Score 3 (High) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Frequency** | Monthly or less | Weekly | Daily or more |
| **Time per execution** | < 5 min | 5–30 min | > 30 min |
| **Error risk (manual)** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Impact if delayed** | Informational | Operational | Security-critical |
| **Complexity to automate** | High (custom dev) | Medium (API calls) | Low (built-in feature) |

**Scoring:**
- **12–15**: Automate immediately
- **8–11**: Plan for next quarter
- **5–7**: Keep manual, reassess later

## SOAR Playbook Quick Reference

> These map to the [SOAR Playbook Templates](../05_Incident_Response/SOAR_Playbooks.en.md).

| Playbook | Trigger | Key Actions | Auto Level |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| PB-PHISH | User report / email alert | Quarantine → URL scan → notify user | L2 |
| PB-MALWARE | EDR detection | Isolate → collect evidence → ticket | L2 |
| PB-BRUTE | 10+ failed logins | Check geo → check MFA → block/alert | L2 |
| PB-IOC-BLOCK | TI feed match | Verify → add to blocklist → notify | L3 |
| PB-ACCT-COMP | Confirmed compromise | Disable → reset → MFA re-enroll → ticket | L2 |
| PB-LOG-HEALTH | Source silent > 30 min | Check → alert SOC → ticket to engineering | L3 |

## Automation Release Guardrails

| Control | Owner | Minimum Requirement |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Documented trigger and scope** | SOAR Engineer | Define exactly what starts the automation and what systems it may touch |
| **Human approval point** | SOC Manager | Required for account disablement, host isolation, or blocking actions unless pre-approved |
| **Rollback path** | Security Engineer | Every automation that changes state must have a tested rollback or recovery action |
| **Execution logging** | SOC Analyst | Store who approved, what ran, and what artifacts changed |
| **Failure handling** | SOAR Engineer | Automation must fail closed or escalate, not silently stop |

## Good Candidates for Automation vs Manual Review

| Process Type | Automate When | Keep Manual When |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Alert enrichment** | Inputs are structured and output is advisory | Source quality is inconsistent |
| **IOC blocking** | Confidence is high and expiry is defined | Blocking may disrupt business-critical partners |
| **Containment actions** | Approval workflow is explicit and blast radius is low | Asset is privileged, regulated, or production-critical |
| **Reporting** | Data sources are normalized and stable | Narrative judgment is required for executives |
