# Shift Operations & Handoff Standard

This document defines the standard procedures for managing SOC shifts and ensuring **zero-drop operational continuity** during shift handovers. A disciplined handoff process prevents incidents from falling through the cracks and ensures consistent service quality 24/7.

## 1. Shift Structure

### 1.1 Standard Rotation (24/7 — 8-Hour Shifts)

| Shift | Hours | Duration | Peak Alert Volume |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| ☀️ **Morning** | 08:00 – 16:00 | 8 hours | High (business hours, phishing, user reports) |
| 🌅 **Afternoon** | 16:00 – 00:00 | 8 hours | Medium (automated scans, overseas attackers) |
| 🌙 **Night** | 00:00 – 08:00 | 8 hours | Low–Medium (botnet activity, scheduled jobs) |

> ⚠️ **30-minute overlap** is required between shifts for proper handoff (e.g., outgoing shift stays 08:00–08:30 with incoming shift).

### 1.2 Alternative Rotation: 4-On-4-Off (12-Hour Shifts)

A compressed schedule using **2 shifts × 12 hours** with 4 consecutive working days followed by 4 days off. This model provides 24/7 coverage with fewer handoffs per day.

| Shift | Hours | Duration | Peak Alert Volume |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| ☀️ **Day Shift** | 08:00 – 20:00 | 12 hours | High (full business hours + early evening) |
| 🌙 **Night Shift** | 20:00 – 08:00 | 12 hours | Low–Medium (botnet, overnight scanning, APT) |

> ⚠️ **30-minute overlap** at 07:30–08:00 and 19:30–20:00 for handoff.

#### Team Rotation Calendar (4-Week Cycle)

Four teams (**Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta**) rotate to ensure 24/7 coverage:

| Week | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Week 1** | 🅰️D | 🅰️D | 🅰️D | 🅰️D | 🅱️D | 🅱️D | 🅱️D |
| **Week 2** | 🅱️D | 🅰️N | 🅰️N | 🅰️N | 🅰️N | 🅱️N | 🅱️N |
| **Week 3** | 🅱️N | 🅱️N | 🅲D | 🅲D | 🅲D | 🅲D | 🅳D |
| **Week 4** | 🅳D | 🅳D | 🅳D | 🅲N | 🅲N | 🅲N | 🅲N |

*D = Day (08:00–20:00), N = Night (20:00–08:00) — Teams not shown are on their 4 days off.*

> **Note**: Teams on days off serve as **on-call backup** for the first 2 of their 4 off-days.

#### 4on4off vs 3-Shift Comparison

| Criteria | 3-Shift (8h) | 4on4off (12h) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Shifts per day** | 3 | 2 |
| **Handoffs per day** | 3 | 2 (fewer = less info loss) |
| **Hours per shift** | 8 hours | 12 hours |
| **Days on / off** | 5 on / 2 off | 4 on / 4 off |
| **Minimum FTE (24/7)** | 12–15 | 8–10 |
| **Fatigue risk** | Lower per shift | Higher per shift (mitigate with breaks) |
| **Work-life balance** | Standard schedule | More consecutive days off |
| **Best for** | Large SOC, high alert volume | Mid-size SOC, cost optimization |

#### Fatigue Mitigation (12-Hour Shifts)

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **Mandatory breaks** | 30-min meal break + 15-min break every 3 hours |
| **Task rotation** | Switch between triage/investigation every 4 hours |
| **No consecutive blocks** | Max 4 consecutive 12h shifts before mandatory 4 days off |
| **Night-to-day transition** | Minimum 4 days off between switching Night → Day |
| **Workload cap** | Max 25 alerts per analyst per 12h shift |

### 1.3 Coverage Models

| Model | Staffing | Best For | Minimum FTE |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| **24/7 Full** | 3 shifts × 365 days | Large SOC, critical infrastructure | 12–15 |
| **24/7 (4on4off)** | 2 shifts × 4 teams | Mid-size SOC, cost optimization | 8–10 |
| **16/5 + On-Call** | 2 shifts weekdays + on-call nights/weekends | Mid-size SOC | 6–8 |
| **8/5 + On-Call** | Business hours + on-call | Small SOC, startup phase | 3–4 |
| **8/5 + MSSP** | Business hours in-house + MSSP after hours | Hybrid SOC | 2–3 + MSSP |

### 1.4 Shift Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|:---|:---|
| **Shift Lead** | Overall shift ownership, escalation decisions, handoff briefing |
| **Tier 1 Analyst** | Alert triage, initial classification, queue management |
| **Tier 2 Analyst** | Investigation, containment, playbook execution |
| **Tier 3 / Hunt** | Threat hunting, advanced forensics, detection engineering |

## 5. Communication Protocols

### 5.1 During Shift

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Ticketing System** | All incident communication (audit trail) | Per SLA |
| **Chat (Teams/Slack)** | Quick coordination, FYI alerts | < 5 min |
| **Phone** | Critical escalation, time-sensitive | Immediate |
| **Email** | Non-urgent updates, reports, documentation | < 1 hour |

### 5.2 Shift Lead Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Frequency |
|:---|:---|
| Monitor queue depth and analyst workload | Hourly |
| Triage and assign incoming alerts/tickets | Continuous |
| Approve containment actions (High/Critical) | As needed |
| Report system issues to IT/Engineering | As needed |
| Document notable events for handoff | End of shift |
| Conduct handoff briefing | End of shift |

## 6. Fatigue Management

SOC analyst burnout is a significant operational risk. The following measures help maintain alertness and quality:

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **Rotation frequency** | Rotate shift patterns every 4–6 weeks |
| **Break schedule** | 15-min break every 2 hours during shift |
| **Task variety** | Rotate between triage, investigation, and hunt |
| **Workload balancing** | Max 15–20 alerts per analyst per shift (8h) |
| **Overtime limits** | Max 2 consecutive shift covers, escalate to management |
| **Mental health** | Access to employee assistance program (EAP) |

---

## 7. Metrics & Quality

### 7.1 Shift KPIs

| Metric | Target | Owner |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Handoff completion rate | 100% | Shift Lead |
| Queue depth at shift end | < 10 unassigned | Shift Lead |
| Average alert response time | < 10 min (MTTA) | Analyst |
| Shift report quality score | ≥ 4/5 (peer review) | SOC Manager |

### 7.2 Handoff Quality Audit

SOC Manager should conduct monthly handoff quality audits:

- [ ] All mandatory sections completed?
- [ ] Active incidents accurately described?
- [ ] System health reported?
- [ ] Verbal briefing conducted (confirmed by both leads)?
- [ ] Issues from previous shift handoffs resolved?

## 8. Escalation Triggers During Handoff

| Trigger | Escalate To | Reason |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **P1/P2 incident has no clear next owner** | SOC Manager + IR Lead | Ownership ambiguity creates immediate response risk |
| **Critical system health gap persists into next shift** | Security Engineer | Detection continuity is degraded |
| **Pending action depends on external team beyond SLA** | SOC Manager | Needs management intervention before the next shift inherits the delay |
| **High-risk change window overlaps unresolved incident** | IR Lead + Change Owner | Prevents operational collision and evidence loss |

## 9. War Room Handoff Rules

| Handoff Item | Minimum Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| **Commander status** | Confirm current Incident Commander and backup for the next shift |
| **War room channel** | Confirm the active bridge, chat room, or call link |
| **Next update deadline** | Record the exact time of the next management or stakeholder update |
| **Open decisions** | List tradeoffs awaiting approval and current blockers |
| **External path** | State whether legal, privacy, customer, regulator, or media coordination is active |

## 10. Monitoring and Closure Handoff Rules

| Handoff Item | Minimum Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| **Enhanced monitoring owner** | Name who owns the watch window, duration, and escalation threshold |
| **Exit criteria** | Record what must be true before leaving enhanced monitoring |
| **War room exit status** | State whether war room closure is pending, approved, or blocked |
| **Closure blockers** | Record any unresolved remediation, notification, or validation item preventing case closure |

## 11. Minimum Evidence in Every Handoff

| Artifact | Minimum Standard |
|:---|:---|
| **Incident summary** | Severity, current hypothesis, assigned owner, and next action |
| **Queue status** | Count of unassigned and aging alerts |
| **System health** | Any log gaps, tooling degradation, or workarounds in place |
| **Escalation record** | What was escalated, to whom, and response received |
