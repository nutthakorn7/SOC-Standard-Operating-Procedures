## Capacity Planning

| Tier | Typical Total EPS | SIEM License Impact | Storage (90 days) |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|
| **Small SOC** (< 500 hosts) | 5K–15K | Standard tier | 500 GB – 1.5 TB |
| **Medium SOC** (500–5K hosts) | 15K–100K | Enterprise tier | 1.5 – 10 TB |
| **Large SOC** (5K+ hosts) | 100K–1M+ | Premium tier | 10 – 100+ TB |

### EPS Estimation Formula

```
Daily Events = EPS × 86,400
Storage (GB/day) = Daily Events × Avg Event Size (bytes) / 1,073,741,824
90-day Storage = Storage/day × 90
```

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Owner |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Review log source health | Daily | SOC Tier 1 |
| Validate EPS vs baseline | Weekly | SOC Engineering |
| Update matrix (new sources) | Monthly | SOC Lead |
| Full gap analysis review | Quarterly | SOC Manager + CISO |
| Compliance mapping audit | Annually | GRC / Compliance |

---

## Minimum Logging Baseline by Use Case

| Use Case | Required Sources | Recommended Enrichment | Blind Spot If Missing |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Identity abuse / account compromise** | AD or IdP sign-in logs, MFA platform, VPN gateway | DHCP, EDR, geo-IP | Cannot verify who logged in, from where, or whether MFA failed |
| **Endpoint execution / malware** | Windows Security, Sysmon, EDR, AV/EPP | DNS, proxy, threat intel | Process lineage and post-execution activity become weak |
| **Phishing / BEC** | Email gateway, M365 UAL or equivalent, IdP logs | Sandbox verdicts, DLP, URL click logs | Message delivery and account follow-on activity cannot be tied together |
| **Data exfiltration** | Proxy, DLP, storage audit, firewall | NetFlow, SaaS audit, DB audit | Large transfers may look like normal traffic with no content context |
| **Cloud abuse** | CloudTrail/Activity/Audit logs, cloud identity logs | VPC/NSG flow logs, CSPM findings | Privileged API misuse and public exposure changes may go unseen |
| **Web attack / API abuse** | WAF, web server, application logs | DB audit, threat intel, CDN logs | Attack path stops at the edge and misses downstream impact |

## Data Quality Checks and Escalation Triggers

| Check | Owner | Acceptable Threshold | Escalate When |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Ingestion freshness** | SOC Engineering | No gap beyond agreed source SLA | P1/P2 source missing beyond SLA |
| **Parser coverage** | Security Engineer | Required fields normalized for priority sources | Critical source remains partial for more than one reporting cycle |
| **Clock alignment** | SOC Engineering | Timestamps consistent enough for correlation | Time drift breaks case timelines or MTTD measurement |
| **EPS stability** | SOC Lead | Within documented baseline or approved change window | Sudden drop/spike with no planned change |
| **Retention compliance** | SOC Manager / GRC | Meets incident, audit, and legal needs | Evidence window shorter than investigation requirement |

## Executive View: What Missing Logs Mean

| Missing or Partial Source | Operational Impact | Business Risk |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **IdP / MFA logs** | Weak account-compromise triage | Increased risk of undetected unauthorized access |
| **EDR or Sysmon** | Poor endpoint reconstruction | Slower containment and harder forensic validation |
| **Cloud audit logs** | Limited visibility into admin/API abuse | High risk in cloud governance and breach investigations |
| **Email audit logs** | Cannot confirm user action after phishing | Delayed response to BEC and mail-based attacks |
| **Database / SaaS audit** | Weak evidence for data access cases | Regulatory and legal reporting risk |
